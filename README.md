## Mini CSS grid projects

#### part of John Smilga's CSS Tutorial

1. Navbar

- vertical and horizontal navbar depending on screen size

2. Hero

- a banner placed in the center; different backgrounds for small and large screens

3. Cards

- on a small screen: simple single column layout; CSS grid to place social media icons horizontally
- two and three column layout for bigger screen. This is done in two different options: using @media query and dynamically using minmax()

4. Tiles Layout

- one column layout on a smaller screen, two and three column layout for a bigger screen and a tiles layout for the biggest screen; using grid template aria

5. Layout

- using CSS grid: named lines
- small screen: one column layout; making sure that one of the rows is speading all across (the main item takes 100% of the screen)
- medium screen: navbar from vertical to horizontal
- big screen: navbar and sidebar are both horizontal
